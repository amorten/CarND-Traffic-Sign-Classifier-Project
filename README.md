## ** Traffic Sign Recognition***

### The Project
---

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Load the data set 
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report


### The Files
---

The project includes the following files:  

* [writeup.md](./writeup.md) - written report that summarizes the results
* [Traffic\_Sign\_Classifier.ipynb](./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) - the IPython notebook that does everything for this project
* [report.html](./report.html) - for convenience, the above IPython notebook converted to HTML

Additional traffic sign images, which I obtained from Google Maps street view in Berlin and Munich, can be found in the [more\_test\_images](./more_test_images) folder.



For completeness I have included the original README for this project provided by Udacity as [README_Udacity.md](./README_Udacity.md).
